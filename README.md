# repkg
Wallpaper engine PKG extractor/TEX to image converter.
Forked from https://github.com/notscuffed/repkg .
 
# Download & Extraction
To Use Click the Green "Code" button and select Download Zip.
Extract it, go to repkg-installer>repkg-installer>repkgGUI .

# Usage
Double Click rpkgui-1.0.0.
Is just 3 buttons.
First select a scene.pkg,
Then select an output folder,
Finally press start.
After a short time the app will beep letting you know its done, and a handy "open output folder" button will appear.
The app will have extracted the images from the scene using repkg.
If files with the extension .tex or .tex-json remain in the output folder, they can be removed.

### Why is this a thing?
This project aims to create a gui for repkg, and for me to finally finish and electron app. 
Im well aware that something in winform or wpf would have been way better but, two birds one stone.

### License
idk mit or something. Whatever https://github.com/notscuffed/repkg is licensed as.
